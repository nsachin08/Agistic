# Agistic
## The demand-supply chain

Blockchain is a futuristic upcoming technology, and without a doubt, one of its finest impacts is going to be on the demand-supply chain management. The introduction of this technology in our demand-supply chain, especially for perishables and medicines, is going to improve the transparency, authenticity and efficiency of the entire cycle. 

Agistic manages to improve the communication gap between various nodes of the supply-demand chain and prove the authenticity of goods sold. Blockchain adds an extra layer of security and also allows end-users to track exactly where their goods come from improving transparency of the entire process. Users can track exactly where and when their goods were produced, when did they reach the warehouse, what warehouse were they stored in.

## Societal Impact

It removes the necessity for middlemen and other authorities who check for authentication, leading to less corruption and bureaucracy. Our application can also be used to connect all nodes of the demand-supply chain, especially for perishable items, to NGOs and other organizations so that there is no food wastage. It is a very scalable solution and can be started small, say, with one manufacturer and one warehouse and can be easily scaled up from there.

## Conclusion

The impacts are many, and hence we definitely believe this concept can become an important technology in the future.
